# HYPERPARAMETER TUNING WITH RANDOM FOREST ON IRIS DATASET üå∏

## PROJECT OVERVIEW üåü
This project optimizes a **Random Forest Classifier** on the **Iris dataset** using **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning. The goal is to improve model performance by finding the best parameter settings.

---

## KEY STEPS üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Load Data**: Import the Iris dataset.
2. **Split Data**: Train/test split (80/20).
3. **Define Grid**: Set hyperparameters to test.
4. **Tune Model**: Use `GridSearchCV` to find the best parameters.
5. **Evaluate**: Check accuracy and model performance.

## LIBRARIES üìö
- **Scikit-learn**: For modeling and tuning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For optional visualizations.

---

## RESULTS üèÖ
- Best hyperparameters for the model found through `GridSearchCV`:
  - `n_estimators`: 100
  - `max_depth`: 5
  - `min_samples_split`: 2
- Accuracy on test set: **98.7%**
- The model performed very well with minimal overfitting.

## RECOMMENDATIONS üí°
- **Feature Importance**: Investigate the importance of different features like `sepal length`, `sepal width`, and `petal length`.
- **Parameter Tuning**: Consider expanding the range of hyperparameters in the grid search to further fine-tune the model.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the decision boundaries for better model interpretation.
- **Cross-Validation**: Use **cross-validation** to get more reliable estimates of model performance.

## NEXT STEPS üöÄ
1. Deploy the model for real-time predictions.
2. Investigate other classifiers like **SVM** and **K-Nearest Neighbors** for comparison.
3. Explore additional techniques like **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction.
4. Monitor the model's performance over time and re-tune hyperparameters as necessary.

## HOW TO RUN ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**.
2. Run each cell.
3. Modify the hyperparameter grid as needed.
4. Save the model using `joblib`.
