 Project 1: Model Hyperparameter Tuning
Project Title: Model Hyperparameter Tuning
Description:
This project demonstrates the application of hyperparameter tuning to improve a machine learning model's performance. Using the Iris dataset, we optimize a Random Forest Classifier's parameters using Grid Search. The goal is to find the best combination of hyperparameters that results in the highest model accuracy.

Key Concepts:
Hyperparameter tuning: Fine-tuning the model’s hyperparameters to enhance performance.

Grid Search: An exhaustive search method that tries all combinations of hyperparameters in the specified grid to find the best combination.

Cross-validation: Used to validate the model’s performance on unseen data.

Steps:
Load and preprocess data:

The Iris dataset is loaded using sklearn.datasets.load_iris().

The data is preprocessed by splitting it into features (X) and target (y).

Split data into training and test sets:

The dataset is split into a training set (80%) and a test set (20%) using train_test_split().

Define parameter grid:

A grid of hyperparameters (e.g., n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split, etc.) is defined for the Random Forest model.

Apply GridSearchCV:

GridSearchCV is used to perform an exhaustive search over the parameter grid.

It fits the model with all combinations of parameters and evaluates using cross-validation.

Evaluate the best model:

After Grid Search, the best model and its corresponding parameters are retrieved.

The accuracy of the best model is evaluated on the test set.

Libraries Used:
scikit-learn: For building and tuning the Random Forest Classifier.

pandas: For data manipulation.

numpy: For numerical operations.

matplotlib: For plotting graphs.

How to Use:
Open the notebook in Google Colab.

Run all the cells in sequence.

Adjust the hyperparameter grid as needed to explore different combinations.

Save the model after tuning.

Example Output:
The output will include the tuned model's performance metrics and the best set of hyperparameters found through grid search.
